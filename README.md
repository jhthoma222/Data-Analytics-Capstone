The NBA is global and is considered to be the highest level of professional basketball.  There are currently thirty teams divided into two conferences.  Eastern conference and Western conference.  The typical NBA season is 82 games.  The NBA teams play 82 games to get the best season record.  The top eight teams from each conference make the playoffs.  Once the teams make the playoffs, they battle it out to get one winner from each conference.  The winners of each conference will then compete for the championship.  The NBA gathers all of the prize money into a pool and divides that pool amongst the playoff teams.  In 2020 the playoff pool was around $22 Million (Bhattacharyya, 2021).
As a Consultant for NBA teams, teams hire me to analyze historical NBA team data to try and predict future NBA scenarios.  I will start by analyzing the statistical data of NBA teams from 1990-2020.  I will try to determine if there are certain features that playoff teams have.  I will then use those features to attempt to predict which teams have the best chance at making the 2021 playoffs.
